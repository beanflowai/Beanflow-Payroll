## Alberta Employment Standards - Holiday Pay Rules

### Eligibility Requirements

**Employee must meet ALL of the following:**

1. **Employment Duration**: At least 30 days employed before the holiday
   - Jonathan: Nov 21 to Dec 25 = **34 days** ✓ **ELIGIBLE**

   - Last scheduled day before Dec 25: Dec 24 (Wed) - worked 5.0h ✓
   - First scheduled day after Dec 25: Dec 26 (Fri) - worked 8.0h ✓
   - **Result**: COMPLIES ✓

3. **Regular Work Day**: For Alberta, the holiday must fall on a "regular work day"
   - Determined by "5 of 9" rule: If employee worked on the same day of week at least 5 times in the 9 weeks before the holiday
   - Holiday: Thursday, Dec 25
   - Thursdays worked in 9 weeks before holiday: 3 (Nov 27, Dec 4, Dec 18)

   - **Result**: 3 ≥ 3 = Thursday IS a regular work day ✓

### Holiday Pay Calculation Method

**When employee did NOT work on the holiday:**

> **Holiday Pay = Average Daily Wage**

**Average Daily Wage = Total wages earned in the 4 weeks immediately before the holiday ÷ Number of days worked in that period**

> **Important Note**: Alberta uses "wages **earned**" (based on hours worked), NOT "wages **paid**" (based on payroll processing dates). This ensures accuracy for new employees.

### Step 1: Define the 4-Week Calculation Period

**Period**: November 27 - December 24, 2025 (28 days before the holiday)

### Step 2: Calculate Total Wages Earned

| **Total Hours Worked** | **93.50 hours** |
| **Hourly Rate** | **$15.00/hour** |
| **Total Wages Earned** | **$1,402.50** |
