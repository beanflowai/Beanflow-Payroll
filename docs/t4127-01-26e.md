## Is this guide for you?
Use this guide if you are a payroll software provider or a company which develops its own in-house payroll solution.
This guide has the formulas you need to determine federal, provincial (except Quebec), and territorial income taxes, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, and employment insurance (EI) premium deductions. The formulas also let you calculate payroll deductions for income sources such as commission, pension, bonuses, and retroactive pay increases.

The formulas used in this guide to calculate statutory deductions have been approved for purposes of the Income Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Employment Insurance Act, as well as their related regulations and any amendments proposed to these acts.

## What’s new for January 1, 2026?

### Indexing
For all federal and provincial or territorial indexed amounts for Income tax, Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), and Employment Insurance (EI), refer to Chapter 8. Unless specified otherwise, indexing means that the values are adjusted based on changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### Federal Changes
On May 27, 2025, the Government of Canada tabled a Notice of Ways and Means Motion with proposed legislation that reduces the lowest income tax rate from 15% to 14%. For 2025, the lowest tax rate was set at 14.5%.
- Effective July 2025, a prorated tax rate of 14% was used.
- For 2026 and subsequent tax years, the lowest federal tax bracket will be 14%.

**2026 Federal Tax Rates and Brackets:**
| Income Bracket | Tax Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Under $58,523 | 14% |
| $58,523 to $117,045 | 20.5% |
| $117,045 to $181,440 | 26% |
| $181,440 to $258,482 | 29% |
| $258,482 and over | 33% |

### Provincial and Territorial Changes

#### Alberta
For 2025 and subsequent tax years, the lowest tax bracket will be 8%. Effective July 1, 2025, a prorated tax rate of 6% was used.

#### Manitoba
- The Manitoba Basic Personal Amount (BPAMB) and the Manitoba personal income tax bracket thresholds will not be indexed for 2025 and subsequent years.
- The maximum BPAMB for 2026 remains at $15,780.
- **2026 Manitoba Tax Brackets:**
  - Under $47,000: 10.8%
  - $47,000 to $100,000: 12.75%
  - $100,000 and over: 17.40%

#### Nova Scotia
For 2026, the BPANS formula should be removed for all employees as it is now set at the maximum regardless of taxable income.

#### Prince Edward Island
Basic Personal Amount (BPA) increased from $14,650 to $15,000, effective January 1, 2026.

#### Saskatchewan
The basic personal exemption, spousal and equivalent-to-spouse exemption, dependent child exemption and senior supplementary amounts are increasing by $500 in each of the next four taxation years (plus annual indexation). For 2026, the BPA will be $20,381.

## Chapter 1 – General information

### Rounding procedures
For all mathematical calculations in this guide, use the following rounding rules except when we specify otherwise.

#### For income tax deductions
If the figure has three or more digits after the decimal point:
- Increase the second digit after the decimal point by one if the third digit is five or more, and drop the third digit.
- If the third digit is less than five, drop the third digit.

#### For Canada Pension Plan (CPP) basic exemption and contributions
- **Basic Exemption:** Divide the annual basic exemption by the number of pay periods. If the figure has three or more digits after the decimal point, drop the third digit.
- **Contributions:** Use the same rounding rule as income tax deductions (round up if 3rd digit ≥ 5).
- **Note:** Rate ratios in formulas are part of the calculation and should not be rounded.

#### For Employment Insurance (EI) premiums
Use the same rounding rule as income tax deductions (round up if 3rd digit ≥ 5).

## Chapter 2 – Personal tax credits returns (Form TD1)

To determine Total federal Claim (TC) and provincial/territorial total claim (TCP), use Form TD1. If a current year Form TD1 has not been provided, update at the beginning of each year using either indexing or claim codes.

### Option 1 – Indexing of Personal Amounts
Calculate revised TC or TCP:
1. Enter the total claim amount reported on Form TD1.
2. Minus: Non-indexed amounts (pension income, tuition, education).
3. Amount subject to annual indexing (1 - 2).
4. Enter the indexing factor.
5. Multiply (3) by (4) (rounded to nearest dollar).
6. Enter non-indexed amounts (from step 2).
7. Revised TC or TCP = (5) + (6).

### Federal Basic Personal Amount (BPAF) Formula (2026)
- If NI* ≤ $181,440: **BPAF = $16,452**
- If $181,440 < NI* < $258,482: **BPAF = $16,452 - (NI* - $181,440) × ($1,623 / $77,042)**
- If NI* ≥ $258,482: **BPAF = $14,829**
*(NI* = A + HD)*

### Manitoba Basic Personal Amount (BPAMB) Formula
- If NI* ≤ $200,000: **BPAMB = $15,780**
- If $200,000 < NI* < $400,000: **BPAMB = $15,780 - (NI* - $200,000) × ($15,780 / $200,000)**
- If NI* ≥ $400,000: **BPAMB = $0**

## Chapter 4 – Option 1 – Tax Formulas

### Step 1 – Annual Taxable Income (A)
**Regular Pay:**
`A = [P × (I – F – F2 – F5A – U1)] – HD – F1`

**Commission Only:**
`A = I1 – F* – F2* – F5A – U1* – HD – F1 – E`

### Step 2 – Basic Federal Tax (T3)
`T3 = (R × A) – K – K1 – K2* – K3 – K4`
*(If negative, T3 = $0)*

**Federal Tax Credits (2026):**
- **K1** = 0.14 × TC
- **K4** = Lesser of (0.14 × A*) or (0.14 × CEA)
- **K2** (CPP/EI Credit) = `[(0.14 × (P × C × (0.0495/0.0595), max $3,519.45 × (PM/12))) + (0.14 × (P × EI, max $1,123.07))]`

### Step 3 – Annual Federal Tax Payable (T1)
`T1 = T3 – (P × LCF)`
*(Quebec: T1 = [(T3 – (P × LCF))* – (0.165 × T3)]*)*

### Step 6 – Pay Period Tax Deduction (T)
`T = [(T1 + T2) / P] + L`
