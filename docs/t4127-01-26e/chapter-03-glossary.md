## 3.4 Common Formula Patterns

### Annualization

To convert pay period amounts to annual amounts:

```
Annual Amount = Pay Period Amount × P
```

### De-annualization

To convert annual amounts to pay period amounts:

```
Pay Period Amount = Annual Amount ÷ P
```

### Tax Credit Calculation

```
Tax Credit = Tax Credit Rate × Credit Amount
```

For federal tax credits, the rate is generally **14%** (0.14).

### Contribution Calculation

```
Contribution = (Earnings - Exemption) × Contribution Rate
```

## 3.5 Special Notes

### Rounding

All calculations should follow the rounding procedures specified in Chapter 1:
- Income tax: Round to 2 decimal places (3rd digit ≥ 5 rounds up)
- CPP basic exemption: Drop 3rd digit (no rounding up)
- CPP contributions: Round to 2 decimal places (3rd digit ≥ 5 rounds up)
- EI premiums: Round to 2 decimal places (3rd digit ≥ 5 rounds up)

### Negative Values

If any calculated value is negative:
- Set the value to **$0**
- This is common for tax credits when income is low

### Maximum Contributions

Always apply maximum contribution limits:
- CPP: $4,230.45 (2026)
- CPP2: $416.00 (2026)
- EI: $1,123.07 (2026, Canada except QC)
