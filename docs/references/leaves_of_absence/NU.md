## Province-Specific Notes
- **Family Violence**: 10 days unpaid (aligns with older versions of NT/Federal standards).
- **Family Responsibility Leave**: Merged category for short-term sickness and bereavement (up to 5 days).
- **Compassionate Care**: Nunavut still lists 8 weeks in some older materials, but typically follows federal EI standards (27-28 weeks).
