## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
Employees are eligible for domestic violence leave if they have been employed at least **90 days** with the same employer.

The leave applies if the employee, their dependent child, or a protected adult living with them is a victim of domestic violence.

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
- Up to **10 days of unpaid leave** each calendar year.
- The leave is job-protected.

### 3. Payment Calculation
Statutory leave is unpaid in Alberta.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
Employees must give the employer as much notice as possible. While there's no specific documentation mandated by law, an employer may request reasonable evidence that the employee is entitled to the leave.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Alberta does not provide *paid* domestic violence leave, unlike BC, MB, SK, and ON, which provide 3-5 days of paid leave. Alberta's 90-day eligibility period is also stricter than BC's immediate eligibility.
