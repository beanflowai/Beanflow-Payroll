## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
Employees with at least **3 months** of continuous service are eligible.

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
- Up to **26 weeks of unpaid leave** in a 12-month period.
- Applies if the employee or their minor child is a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or a criminal offense.

### 3. Payment Calculation
Unpaid. (Note: The first 2 days of absence for sickness/family obligations per year are paid in QC, but there's no specific "Family Violence" paid category separate from the general 2 days).

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
Employees must notify the employer as soon as possible. Documentation confirming the situation may be requested.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Quebec provides a significantly longer *unpaid* block (26 weeks) than most provinces (which usually offer 15-17 weeks). However, it does not have a dedicated "5 paid days" category specifically for family violence like BC or ON.

## Changelog
