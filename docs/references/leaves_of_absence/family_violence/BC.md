## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
All employees in British Columbia are eligible for this leave as soon as they start employment. There is no waiting period (unlike sick leave which requires 90 days).

The leave applies if the employee or an "eligible person" (a child or a dependent) experiences domestic or sexual violence.

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
The leave consists of three parts per calendar year:
1. **Up to 5 days of paid leave**.
2. **Up to 5 days of unpaid leave**.
3. **Up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave** (which can be taken in a single block or multiple blocks with employer agreement).

### 3. Payment Calculation
- **Rate**: Average day's pay.
- **Formula**: Total wages earned (excluding overtime) in the 30 calendar days before the leave, divided by the number of days the employee worked or earned wages in that period.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
Employees must request the leave and provide notice as soon as practicable. While employers can request "reasonable evidence," the BC Ministry has clarified that they should not require police reports or private medical details due to the sensitive nature of the leave.

### 5. Purpose of Leave
The leave can be used for:
- Seeking medical attention for physical or psychological injury.
- Accessing victim services or other social services.
- Obtaining psychological or other professional counseling.
- Relocating (temporarily or permanently).
- Seeking legal or law enforcement assistance, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
BC is among the most supportive provinces, providing 5 days of *paid* leave. Federal standards also provide 5 days paid, but some provinces (e.g., AB, SK) provide less or no paid leave for this category.
