## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
Employees are eligible after **13 weeks** of employment.

The leave applies if the employee, their child, or a person for whom the employee is a caregiver is a victim of interpersonal violence (domestic or sexual).

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
Saskatchewan provides a dual entitlement:
1. **10 Days total**: 5 days **paid** and 5 days **unpaid** (can be taken intermittently or consecutively).
2. **16 Weeks total**: A further continuous period of unpaid leave.

### 3. Payment Calculation
- **Rate**: Regular hourly rate for the hours the employee would have worked.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
Employees must provide as much notice as possible. Employers can request reasonable evidence.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Saskatchewan is among the national leaders in this category, providing 5 days of paid leave. The recent 2026 extension to include a 16-week continuous block makes it one of the most comprehensive policies in Canada.
