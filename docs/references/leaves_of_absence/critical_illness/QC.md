## Detailed Rules

### 1. Absence for Sickness (FOR SELF)
- **Duration**: Up to 26 weeks in a 12-month period.
- **Eligibility**: 3 months service.
- **Note**: This is similar to the 27-week standard in other provinces.

### 2. Critical Illness / Care for Relative
- **Care for family member**: 16 weeks (general) or up to 27 weeks if life-threatening.
- **Care for minor child**: Up to 36 weeks if critically ill/injured.
- **Eligibility**: 3 months service.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Quebec's 26-week self-sickness leave is one week shorter than the 27-week standard being adopted in 2025/2026 by other provinces to match EI, but it remains one of the more protective frameworks.
