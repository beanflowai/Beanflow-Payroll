## Detailed Rules

### 1. Serious Illness or Injury Leave (FOR SELF)
**Effective November 27, 2025**, employees are entitled to up to **27 weeks of unpaid leave** per 52-week period if they are unable to work due to a serious illness or injury.
- **Eligibility**: Immediate (no waiting period).
- **Documentation**: Must obtain a medical certificate confirming the inability to work and the expected return date.
- **Usage**: Can be taken in blocks of one or more weeks.

### 2. Critical Illness or Injury Leave (TO CARE FOR OTHERS)
This leave allows employees to care for a family member whose life is at risk.
- **Eligibility**: Immediate.
- **Duration (Child)**: Up to 36 weeks to care for a child under 19.
- **Duration (Adult)**: Up to 16 weeks to care for a family member 19 or older.
- **Requirement**: A medical certificate stating the person's life is at risk and they need care.

### 3. Payment Calculation
These leaves are unpaid under the ESA. Employees may be eligible for Federal **EI Critical Care Benefits**.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
Employees must provide a medical certificate from a physician or nurse practitioner. Notice should be given as soon as possible.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
BC's introduction of the 27-week self-illness leave aligns it with federal standards (which also provide 27 weeks of unpaid medical leave / EI sickness benefits). BC is among the first to explicitly match the 27-week federal duration for provincial employees.
