## Province-Specific Notes
- **Family Violence**: One of the most generous in the Atlantic region (5 paid days + 5 unpaid + 16 weeks).
- **Bereavement**: Entitlement is 5 unpaid days.
- **Sick Leave**: NB only mandates 5 *unpaid* days per year, which is lower than the 5 *paid* day standard emerging in BC/Federal.
