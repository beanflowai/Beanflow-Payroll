## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
All employees in British Columbia are eligible for bereavement leave as soon as they start employment. It applies when there is a death of an **immediate family member**.

**Immediate family** includes:
- Spouses (including common-law and same-sex spouses)
- Children, step-children, and foster children
- Parents, step-parents, and foster parents
- Siblings and step-siblings
- Grandparents and grandchildren
- Any person who lived with the employee as a member of the employee's family

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
- Employees are entitled to up to **3 days of unpaid leave** for *each instance* of a death of an immediate family member.
- These days do not need to be taken consecutively.
- **Child Death Leave**: Special provision (unpaid) up to 104 weeks if a child (<19) dies.

### 3. Payment Calculation
Not applicable as the statutory leave is unpaid. Employers may choose to provide paid bereavement leave as a benefit.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
The employee must notify the employer as soon as possible. Employers may request reasonable evidence of the death and the relationship to the deceased.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
BC's 3-day unpaid entitlement is standard, although some provinces like Ontario offer 2 days. The federal standard (Canada Labour Code) provides up to 10 days, with the first 3 days paid if the employee has 3 months of service. BC does not mandate any paid days for bereavement.
