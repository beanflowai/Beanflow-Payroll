## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
Employees are eligible for bereavement leave after **90 days** of employment with the same employer.

It applies to the death of a family member, including:
- Immediate family (spouse, child, parent, sibling)
- Extended family (grandparent, aunt, uncle, etc.)
- Pregnancy loss of the employee or their spouse/partner.

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
- **3 days of unpaid leave** per calendar year (not per instance, unlike BC).
- This is a minimum standard; many employers provide more through employment contracts.

### 3. Payment Calculation
Statutory leave is unpaid.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
The employee must provide notice as soon as reasonable. Employers may request documentation (e.g., obituary, death certificate).

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Alberta's bereavement leave is limited to 3 days *per year*, whereas BC provides 3 days *per instance*. Alberta explicitly includes pregnancy loss in its bereavement coverage.
