## Detailed Rules

### 1. Eligibility
Employees are eligible after **13 weeks** of employment.

Effective **January 1, 2026**, the definition of family was expanded to include "individuals considered like family" and coverage for pregnancy loss.

### 2. Entitlement & Duration
- **5 days of unpaid leave** for the death of a family member.
- **Timing**: The leave can now be taken any time within 6 months of the death (previously restricted to the time around the funeral).

### 3. Payment Calculation
Statutory leave is unpaid.

### 4. Notice & Documentation Requirements
The employee must provide notice as soon as possible.

## Comparison with Federal/Other Provinces
Saskatchewan's 5-day entitlement is more generous than BC (3 days) and Ontario (2 days). The flexibility to use the 5 days within 6 months is a modern provision not seen in all jurisdictions.

## Changelog
- 2026-01-15: Initial documentation including Jan 2026 expansions.
