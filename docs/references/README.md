# Official Policy References

This directory contains official policy documentation from Canadian provincial/territorial government sources.

## Purpose

1. **Traceability** - Every config in `backend/config/` can be traced to an official source
2. **Auditability** - Easy to compare implementation vs official policy
3. **Maintenance** - Track when policies were last verified and need updates
